# go-todo-lambda
Simple Go Lang Todo application for AWS Lambda with DynamoDB

# Why I made this?

Just to pratice some AWS services.

# Which AWS Services I used?

- DynamoDB for the database layer
- Lambda for the Serveless application layer
- API Gateway for the front application layer

# How I can deploy this project?

You should just run the `build.sh` file to compile the Go project and the, run the `terraform apply` command to deploy it into **your** AWS account.

# Suggestion? 

Yes! I accept then =)
